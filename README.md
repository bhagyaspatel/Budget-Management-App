# Budget-Management-App
As part of a Google Developer Student's Club 's Android Coding JAM, we built a  budget tracking app using firebase. 
"This was my first app project that too a group project and i learned a lot from this."

My part was to validate the input data and to set the fragment view data with the user's input data.
